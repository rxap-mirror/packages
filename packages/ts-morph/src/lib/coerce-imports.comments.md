# Divide exported typescript into smaller utility functions

The exported function, `CoerceImports`, contains logic to manage import lines in a TypeScript file, specifically, it evokes different functions depending on whether the import is a name import, a namespace import, or a default import. 

This code is already broken down into several utility functions: `coerceDefaultImport`, `coerceNamespaceImport`, `isSupportedNamedImports`, `normalizeNamedImports`, and `coerceNamedImports`. All of these functions are private, which is the correct choice as they are not relevant outside the context of coercing imports.

These utility functions are well-extracted and their responsibilities are well defined, each function catering to a specific feature: 

- `coerceDefaultImport` handles the default import lines.
- `coerceNamespaceImport` handles namespace import lines.
- `isSupportedNamedImports` checks if named imports are supported.
- `normalizeNamedImports` normalizes named import lines.
- `coerceNamedImports` handles named imports.

Therefore, I don't see any more room for meaningful decomposition. These functions are tightly coupled to the operation of the exported function and it would not provide significant benefit to further separate them. The functions are already small and readable; further decomposition could impose higher mental overhead for developers maintaining this code. Therefore, I would conclude the function should remain as it is.
